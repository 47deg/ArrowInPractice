# Arrow in practice

Lambda.World CÃ¡diz 2018 workshop hosted by @raulraja and @jorgecastilloprz.

On this workshop we will take a basic REST client coded using [ktor](https://ktor.io/) (@JetBrains) and will iterate over it to put [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) into practice.

Some key points you'll learn:
* How to model your application data using Arrow datatypes.
* How to operate and transform the data using Typeclasses defined behaviors.
* How typeclasses are considered abstractions.
* How to achieve polymorphism using typeclasses.
* How to use Optics to query and modify nested immutable data structures.
* How to port an OOP oriented codebase to a pure typed functional style using Arrow.
