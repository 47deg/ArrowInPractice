# Arrow in practice

Lambda.World CÃ¡diz 2018 workshop hosted by [@raulraja](https://twitter.com/raulraja) and [@JorgeCastilloPR](https://twitter.com/JorgeCastilloPR) from [@47Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/).

This workshop starts with a basic **RESTful API** coded using [ktor](https://ktor.io/) ([@JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)). Our intention is to iterate over it converting it to a more functional style by putting [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) into practice.

Some key points you'll learn:
* How to model your application immutable data using Arrow datatypes.
* How to operate over and transform the data using Typeclass defined behaviors.
* How to achieve polymorphism using the power of abstraction of typeclasses.
* How to use Optics to read and modify nested immutable data structures.
* How to encode sequential operations with a fancier syntax using Monad Comprehensions.
* How to encode non-dependent operations using the Applicative Builder.

# Exercises

## 1. Handling nullability

All details endpoint implementations are taking **nullables** now from the Database (they're optional), since the given Id could not exist. You must 
translate that concern to a FP related data type. Do it for the [GetCharacterDetails Endpoint](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md#get-http00008080charactersid).

To double check your changes, run [GetCharacterDetailsTest.kt](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/com/fortysevendeg/arrowinpractice/characters/GetCharacterDetailsTest.kt) suite. You've got tests for both scenarios there (found and not found). They should keep passing. 

## 2. Handling exceptions

Any data base access is prone to throw exceptions, since it mimics a real DB access. That means we should <b>try</b> to cover that case. :wink: 

Staying on the same endpoint, you'll see how it's implementation ([GetCharacterDetails Endpoint](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md#get-http00008080charactersid)) uses `try catch` imperative style block to catch all possible database / parsing exceptions and return an `InvalidIdException` in that case, which translates to an HTTP `BadRequest` error response.

Again, run  [GetCharacterDetailsTest.kt](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/com/fortysevendeg/arrowinpractice/characters/GetCharacterDetailsTest.kt) suite to validate your changes are correct. There's a test covering this case. Response should not vary and tests should keep passing.

## 3. Handling authentication

All endpoints (except the welcome one) are authenticated using `Basic` auth. The auth credentials are the following string encoded in Base64:
```
Basic georgerrmartin:lambdaworldrules
```

This is a validation and there's a data type for that type of error control in Arrow. Please switch the implementation to it for the [GetCharacterDetails Endpoint](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md#get-http00008080charactersid)).

## 4. Independent computations

There's an endpoint called [/jammielannister/seats](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md#get-http00008080jamielannisterseats) that 
encodes two **independent computations** that require to combine results in the end. You probably know how to do that using FP.

To validate this one, you can go to the [GetJamieLannisterSeatsTest](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/com/fortysevendeg/arrowinpractice/castles/GetJamieLannisterSeatsTest.kt) suite and run it.

## 5. Dependent (sequential) computations

There's an endpoint called [got](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md#get-http00008080got) that encodes 
three **sequential (dependent) computations** to compose a combined result in the end. You know what that means, right? :stuck_out_tongue:

To validate this one, go to [GetGotTest.kt](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/com/fortysevendeg/arrowinpractice/got/GetGotTest.kt) and run the suite.

## 6. Async computations

Every call is done asynchronously using Ktor framework behind the scenes. You should be able to translate that to <b>Async</b> constraints with Arrow.

Please, iterate [GetCharacterDetails Endpoint](https://github.com/47deg/ArrowInPractice/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md#get-http00008080charactersid) one more time to achieve asynchrony without relying on the Ktor framework as is.

# Serialization

All content negotiation (serialization / deserialization) is handled using the `Ktor` built in `Jackson` support.

# Endpoints

For detailed docs per endpoint providing `Request` and `Response` **Json** formats check the [endpoint docs](./ENDPOINTS.md).

# Testing / Running the endpoints

## Http Request Built-in support

There are `HTTP Request` files for each one of the endpoints into the `httpqueries` folder in the root directory. If you 
have IntellIJ Ultimate installed, you can run them just by using the IDE and perform a real request to the endpoint. (Don't 
forget to run the app so you get your local server deployed to localhost).

## Tests

There are also Unit tests per endpoint covering all the required cases we're interested in. So don't worry if you don't own a IntellIJ Idea Ultimate serial, since 
we expect you to validate endpoints when you need using the unit tests. Run them like:
```
./gradlew test
``` 
You can also use the IDE tools (play icon to run tests on test class declarations or right click in test packages -> "run all tests in"...)
